A good example was OpenText, which was reported to be selling companies the right to be listed at the top of the search results for particular queries [Marchiori 97]. This type of bias is much more insidious than advertising, because it is not clear who \"deserves\" to be there, and who is willing to pay money to be listed. This business model resulted in an uproar, and OpenText has ceased to be a viable search engine. But less blatant bias are likely to be tolerated by the market. For example, a search engine could add a small factor to search results from \"friendly\" companies, and subtract a factor from results from competitors. This type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on the market. Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results. For example, we noticed a major search engine would not return a large airline's homepage when the airline's name was given as a query. It so happened that the airline had placed an expensive ad, linked to the query that was its name. A better search engine would not have required this ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the advertising supported business model of the existing search engines. However, there will always be money from advertisers who want a customer to switch products, or have something that is genuinely new. But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.Untitled","lastmodified":"2024-09-27T10:55:09.549548197Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Philosophy":{"title":"Philosophy","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2024-09-27T10:55:09.549548197Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Reid-Hoffman-on-philosophy-for-AI":{"title":"Reid Hoffman on philosophy for AI","content":"[[notes/Philosophy|Philosophy]]\n[[notes/Computer Science|Computer Science]]\n\nSourced from the Conversations with Tyler Podcast episode with Reid Hoffman.
