The big question is whether to use LLMs while going through these resources. If LLMs such as Gemini can seem to problem solve effectively, it seems that focusing more on knowing what's possible and software architecture and building projects fast matters more.

1. Dataquest Data Science in Python 
2. Mathematical Proofs + Discrete Maths/Algos course at LSE
3. Leetcode + Hackerrank + advent of code type questions
4. Books such as a Primer on Systems Engineering
5. Miscellaneous courses on solutions graphs, computer architecture, and in general working through blog posts such as the Jane Street tech blog
