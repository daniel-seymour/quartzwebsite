<h3>About me</h3>

Hello! I'm Daniel. It's great to meet you.

I'm an undergraduate studying Philosophy and Economics at the London School of Economics. 

You can read some of my writing on Substack at <a href="https://danielseymour.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile" target="_blank">Systems</a>. I will be gradually adding some note style writing to this website.

You can also access my CV <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FlcYvraJagj_zvrE9I2p3JmBD9jD4V1u/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p> If you'd like to chat, please drop me an email at <a href="mailto:d.seymour@lse.ac.uk">d.seymour@lse.ac.uk</a> - I'd love to talk. </p>
