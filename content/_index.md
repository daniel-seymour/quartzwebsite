<h3>About me</h3>

<p>Hello! I'm Daniel. It's great to meet you.</p>

<p>I'm a final year undergraduate studying Econometrics and Mathematical Economics at the London School of Economics.</p>

<p>Currently building <a href="https://www.protopiagroup.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protopia Group</a>, a non-profit think tank researching growth and innovation through careful data analysis.</p>

<p>Previous experience in tech and start-ups as a product manager at <a href="https://www.expediagroup.com/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expedia</a> (travel) and product operations at <a href="https://www.semble.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semble</a> (healthcare).</p>

<p>I write a Substack called Systems by Daniel Seymour, where I try to have opinions, and then test them! You can explore it <a href="https://danielseymour.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also love the similarly named <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick McKenzie Complex Systems podcast</a>.</p>
