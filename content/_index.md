<h3>About me</h3>

<p>Hello! I'm Daniel. It's great to meet you.</p>

<p>I'm an undergraduate studying Philosophy and Economics at the London School of Economics.</p>

<p>You can read some of my writing on Substack <a href="https://danielseymour.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I will be gradually adding more short, note-style writing to this website.</p>

<p>You can also access my CV <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n1P-oDuQnDqnwiMej-FtG73cmP8y02h9/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to chat, please drop me an email at <a href="mailto:d.seymour@lse.ac.uk">d.seymour@lse.ac.uk</a> - I'd love to talk.</p>
