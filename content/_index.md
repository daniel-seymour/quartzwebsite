Hello! I'm Daniel. It's great to meet you.

I'm an undergraduate studying Philosophy and Economics at the London School of Economics. 

My longform writing is on Substack at Systems, and I will be publishing some notes on here too. 

If you'd like to chat, please drop me an email - I'd love to talk.
